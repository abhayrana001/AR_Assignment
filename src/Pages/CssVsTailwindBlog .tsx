          Choosing between traditional CSS and Tailwind CSS is a common decision for front-end developers.
          Both approaches have their strengths, and understanding the differences can help you pick the right tool for your next project.

          <br /><br />
          1. What is Traditional CSS?
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard way of styling HTML. You write styles in `.css` files and apply them via class or element selectors.
          It offers full control over styling but requires you to name and manage many classes.

          <br /><br />
          2. What is Tailwind CSS?
          Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose styles directly in your HTML or JSX using utility classes like `p-4`, `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, etc.

          <br /><br />
          3. Pros of Traditional CSS:
          • Full control and flexibility over styling<br />
          • Easier to learn for beginners<br />
          • Styles are reusable and scoped via classes

          <br /><br />
          4. Cons of Traditional CSS:
          • Can become messy and hard to maintain in large projects<br />
          • You often end up writing lots of custom classes<br />
          • Naming conventions (like BEM) add extra complexity

          <br /><br />
          5. Pros of Tailwind CSS:
          • No need to write custom CSS files<br />
          • Fast development with pre-built utility classes<br />
          • Encourages design consistency<br />
          • Works great with React and component-based design

          <br /><br />
          6. Cons of Tailwind CSS:
          • Can clutter your JSX with long className strings<br />
          • Slight learning curve for the utility naming system<br />
          • Harder to override styles if not properly structured

          <br /><br />
          7. When to Use Traditional CSS:
          • Small static websites<br />
          • Projects with very custom, handcrafted designs<br />
          • When working with designers who provide exact styles

          <br /><br />
          8. When to Use Tailwind CSS:
          • Medium to large applications<br />
          • Component-based frameworks like React, Vue<br />
          • Teams that value design consistency and rapid development

          <br /><br />
          ✨ Final Thoughts:
          CSS gives you ultimate flexibility, but Tailwind offers a fast and scalable way to build modern UIs.
          For most modern front-end projects — especially with React — Tailwind can save a lot of time and headaches.
          That said, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Choose what fits your project best!

          <br /><br />
          Style smart, not hard.

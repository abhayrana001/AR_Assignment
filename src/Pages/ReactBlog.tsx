          React is a powerful JavaScript library, but many developers only scratch the surface of what it can do.
          In this post, weâ€™ll explore some useful tips and lesser-known tricks to help you write cleaner, faster, and more maintainable React code.
<br/>
          1. Use Functional Components Over Class Components
          Functional components are more concise and easier to test. With React Hooks, you get full control over state and lifecycle.
          <br />
          2. Destructure Props Early
          Destructuring makes your code cleaner and reduces repetition.
          <br />
          3. Memoize Expensive Calculations
          Use useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations or function recreation.
          <br />
          4. Avoid Inline Functions in JSX
          Inline functions in JSX can hurt performance due to re-creation on every render.
          <br />
          5. Use classnames or clsx for Conditional Styling
          These libraries help manage complex conditional class names more cleanly.
          <br />
          6. Break Down Large Components
          If a component gets longer than 100 lines or handles multiple concerns, split it into smaller components.
          <br />
          7. Prefer TypeScript
          TypeScript helps catch bugs early and makes your codebase easier to understand.
          <br />
          8. Follow Folder Structures by Feature
          Organize components and logic based on features instead of file type.
          <br />
          9. Use Error Boundaries
          Error boundaries prevent your entire app from crashing and help handle UI-level errors gracefully.
          <br />
          10. Use React DevTools
          React Developer Tools lets you inspect the component tree and hook values in your browser.
          <br />
          Keep learning and refactoring. Great React code is simple, readable, and scalable.

          Happy coding!

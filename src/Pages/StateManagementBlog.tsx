          State is the heart of any interactive React application. As your app grows, managing state across components becomes challenging.
          In this blog, we’ll explore the most common state management approaches in React and when to use each.

          <br /><br />
          1. Local State with <code>useState</code>
          <br />
          This is the most basic form of state management, perfect for managing data within a single component.
          It's simple, fast, and requires no external libraries.
          <br />
          Example: toggling a modal, form inputs, button clicks.

          <br /><br />
          2. Sharing State via Props
          <br />
          You can lift state up to a common parent component and pass it down via props. This works well for small apps but quickly becomes difficult to scale or maintain in deep component trees.

          <br /><br />
          3. <code>useContext</code> + Context API
          <br />
          The Context API allows you to share global state (like theme, auth, or user data) across the app without prop drilling.
          It's great for lightweight global state, but it lacks performance optimizations for frequent updates.

          <br /><br />
          4. Redux (or Redux Toolkit)
          <br />
          Redux is a popular state management library that centralizes state in a global store. It's ideal for large-scale applications with complex state logic.
          Redux Toolkit makes setup easier and reduces boilerplate.

          <br />
          Pros:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Predictable state updates</li>
            <li>DevTools support</li>
            <li>Middleware (like redux-thunk) for async flows</li>
          </ul>

          <br /><br />
          5. Zustand / Jotai / Recoil (Modern Alternatives)
          <br />
          These are newer, lighter libraries that simplify global state with cleaner APIs. Zustand, for example, allows writing state logic with hooks and has no boilerplate.
          These tools are becoming increasingly popular in the React ecosystem.

          <br /><br />
          6. Server-State with React Query / TanStack Query
          <br />
          Not all data belongs in your local/global state. React Query manages server data (API calls, caching, background updates) efficiently.
          It’s perfect for fetching, caching, and syncing data with your backend.

          <br /><br />
          ✨ Final Thoughts:
          <br />
          - Use <code>useState</code> and props for local, simple needs.<br />
          - Use Context API for light global values.<br />
          - Choose Redux or Zustand for complex global state.<br />
          - Use React Query for anything that comes from the server.

          <br /><br />
          Choose the right tool for the job — don’t over-engineer. Simplicity and clarity are key to scalable React apps.

          <br /><br />
          Happy rendering!

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-justify">
          TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making your code more predictable, readable, and maintainable.
          While JavaScript is flexible, that flexibility can sometimes lead to hard-to-track bugs and unclear code.

          <br /><br />
          1. Catch Errors at Compile Time
          TypeScript helps catch common errors like undefined variables, type mismatches, or incorrect function usage — before your app even runs.
          <br />
          This early feedback saves hours of debugging.

          <br /><br />
          2. Better Developer Experience (DX)
          Editors like VS Code offer powerful IntelliSense support for TypeScript: autocomplete, inline documentation, and real-time error reporting.
          This leads to faster, more confident coding.

          <br /><br />
          3. Improves Code Readability
          Explicit types make your functions and components self-documenting.
          You know exactly what inputs are expected and what output is returned — reducing guesswork for others (and future-you).

          <br /><br />
          4. Refactoring is Safer
          With static typing and strong tooling, refactoring large codebases becomes less risky.
          If something breaks, TypeScript will tell you exactly where.

          <br /><br />
          5. Enhances IDE Features
          Your editor becomes smarter with type inference, jump-to-definition, type checking, auto imports, and much more.
          This makes large projects much easier to navigate.

          <br /><br />
          6. Works Seamlessly with React
          TypeScript works exceptionally well with React and JSX.
          You can define prop types, use interfaces, and get better support for hooks like `useState` and `useReducer`.

          <br /><br />
          7. Strong Ecosystem Support
          Most popular libraries now ship with TypeScript types, and many tools (like ESLint, Prettier, Vite, etc.) support it out of the box.

          <br /><br />
          8. Progressive Adoption
          You don’t have to rewrite your entire app. TypeScript can be gradually adopted file-by-file using `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions.

          <br /><br />
          ✨ Final Thoughts:
          TypeScript helps you write more reliable and scalable code.
          For teams and large projects, it’s almost a necessity.
          Even in solo projects, it can drastically improve code quality and productivity.

          <br /><br />
          Happy Typing!
